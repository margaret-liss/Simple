# How to Jump Through to Seated Position in Ashtanga Yoga

This describes how to jump your legs through your arms from Downward Facing Dog to seated position, a frequent maneuver in Ashtanga Yoga.

There are two main methods:

A. Low hips, straight legs

B. High hips, folded legs.

## Prerequisites
A.  To perform either method successfully, you must have sufficient hamstring flexibility, and hip, abdominal/core, and shoulder strength to connect your upper thighs with your lower belly, unite them, and arc that unit through a portal essentially as long as your arms and as wide as your shoulders. Here are a few tests to see if you meet those prerequisites:


1. From standing, fold forward to the extent that you can touch your chest to your thighs, fairly tightly.  You want to be like a hair pin. This requires hamstring/back-body flexibility and hip flexor contraction.
2. From seated, press your hands into the floor by your hips, and lift your self (or butt, at a min) up off the ground using the strength of your shoulders and core. Try it with straight legs and sitting on your shins. Notice that you also have to contract your abdominals and hip flexors, and protract your shoulders to clear the floor.  

B.  You must be sufficiently warmed up, especially for Method A, to avoid getting hurt.  I often don't attempt A until I get to Marichyasanas.  The intense hip flexion of Marichyasana primes the body for that hip-chest connection.  

## Starting position: The Crouch and Spring 
The starting position for both methods A and B is the same: the crouch and spring.

From Downward Facing Dog, come into a crouch position. Push your chest toward your thighs while bending your knees, keeping your butt low and allowing your heels to come up as you push through the balls of your feet. Your tailbone is tucked.  The balls of your feet are pushing you foward, while your hands, arms, shoulders are pushing you backward, like coiled, wound spring.

## Method A: Low hips, straight legs
TIP: For this method, before you get into the crouch position, place a blanket between your thighs and belly. Don't let it slip out the entire time.

From the crouch position, do the following:

1. Look forward -- actually, look forward and up, so that your chin is up.  See where you're going.  Keep looking there.  

2. Release your coil, pushing off your feet, straightening your legs, letting your hips arc up a bit. Quickly execute the next step.

3. Immediatly close the legs to the chest and let momentum shoot your feet through your arms.

4. Lead with your feet but steer with your hips, using your core to drive your hips and legs forward and through the arms. 

## Method B: High hips, folded legs

From the crouch position, do the following:

1. Spring your hips up in an arcing path until they are directly over your shoulders.

2. At the top of the arc, fold your legs, cross your shins and tuck them close your body until they are a unit.

3. Arc your belly-leg compact unit under and forward, through your arms.
