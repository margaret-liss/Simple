# How to Jump Through to Seated Position in Ashtanga Yoga

This describes how to jump your legs through your arms from Downward Facing Dog to seated position, a frequent maneuver in Ashtanga Yoga.

There are two main methods:

A. Low hips, straight legs

B. High hips, folded legs.

## Prerequisites
To perform either method successfully, you must have sufficient hamstring flexibility, and hip, abdominal/core, and shoulder strength to connect your upper thighs with your lower belly, unite them, and arc that unit through a portal essentially as long as your arms and as wide as your shoulders. Here are a few tests to see if you meet those prerequisites:


1. From standing, fold forward to the extent that you can touch your chest to your thighs, fairly tightly.  You want to be like a hair pin. This requires hamstring/back-body flexibility and hip flexor contraction.
2. From seated, press your hands into the floor by your hips, and lift your self (or butt, at a min) up off the ground using the strength of your shoulders and core. Try it with straight legs and sitting on your shins. Notice that you also have to contract your abdominals and hip flexors, and protract your shoulders to clear the floor.    

## Methods A and B starting position 
The starting position for both methods is the same: the crouch and spring.

From Downward Facing Dog, come into a crouch position. Push your chest toward your thighs while bending your knees, keeping your butt low and allowing your heels to come up as you push through the balls of your feet.  The balls of your feet are pushing foward, while your hands, arms, shoulders are pushing you backward. Your knees and chest are compacted like an accordian and you should feel like a wound up spring.

## Method A: Low hips, straight legs
1. Look forward.  See where you're going.  Keep looking there.

2. Push off your feet and allow your hips to arc upward a bit -- like maybe a foot or two.

3. At the top of the arc, connect your thighs to your low belly as you straigen your legs. Keep them connected. TIP: Stick a folded blanket between your thighs and belly.  Don't let it slip out.

4. Lead with your feet but steer with your hips, using your core to drive your hips and legs forward and through the arms.
