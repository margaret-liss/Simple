# How to Jump Through to Seated Position in Ashtanga Yoga.

This describes how to jump your legs through your arms from Downward Facing Dog to seated position, a frequent maneuver in Ashtanga Yoga.

There are two main methods:

A. Low hips, straight legs

B. High hips, folded legs.

## Prerequisites
To perform either method successfully, you must have sufficient hamstring flexibility, and hip, abdominal/core, and shoulder strength to be able to press your lower body against your torso into a unit, and then arc this unit through a portal that is essentially as long as your arms and as wide as your shoulders. Here are a few tests to see if you meet those prerequisites:


1. From standing, fold forward to the extent that you can touch your chest to your thighs, fairly tightly.  You want to be like a hair pin. This requires hamstring/back-body flexibility and hip flexor strength.
2. From seated, lift your self (or butt, at a min) up off the ground using the strength of your shoulders and core. Try it with straight legs and sitting on your shins.

## Starting Position for Both Methods
The starting position for both methods is the same: the crouch and spring.

From Downward Facing Dog, come into a crouch position. Push your chest toward your thighs while bending your knees, keeping your butt low and allowing your heels to come up as you push through the balls of your feet.  The balls of your feet are pushing foward, while your hands, arms, shoulders are pushing you backward. Your knees and chest are compacted like an accordian and you should feel like a wound up spring.
